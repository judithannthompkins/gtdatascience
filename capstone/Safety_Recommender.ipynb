    "The primary proposed hypothesis for the Safety Recommender project is as follows:\n",
    "<p>H1: It is possible to measure crime risk in popular Washington, DC locations by combining information from public databases including Yelp and DC Metro Crime Dataset. We believe we can help stimulate business, increase student safety, and generally reduce crime by providing facts on crime risks for common destinations on the day and time of a planned visit. In addition, by collecting crime-related observations from the public, we could help reduce crime if our information becomes an additional catalyst for business owners and authorities to address the risks. \n",
    "Additionally possible hypotheses are as follows:\n",
    "<p>H2: It is possible to recommend the safest day and time to visit a particular popular Washington, DC by combining public databases including Yelp and DC Metro Crime Dataset. \n",
    "<p>H3: It is possible to use measured safety risk to inform target population of safest location on a given day and time for a specific category (such as Mexican Restaurants) as well as to recommend alternate options based on the safety risk. \n"
